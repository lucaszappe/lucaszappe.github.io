### Entry-level data professional with a background in electrical engineering.

<br>

Hi, I’m Lucas. I work with data to help people make better, more informed decisions.

I’m currently contributing to a national-scale project in Brazil, in partnership with Petrobras’ research center, where I help build Excel-based tools using VBA to support decision-making and streamline internal operations. It’s hands-on, problem-driven work that blends technical skill with a focus on clarity and usability.

My path into data wasn’t traditional. I originally graduated in electrical engineering and later spent several years working in dynamic, people-oriented environments around the world. Over time, I realized I wanted to reconnect with my technical side, and I found that working with data brought together my interest in technology, curiosity, and problem-solving mindset.

Along the way, I’ve developed personal projects using tools like SQL, Excel, Python, R, and Tableau — you can explore some of these in my [portfolio](https://lucaszappe.github.io/portfolio/). I also have experience working with AI tools and applying them in practical contexts to solve real problems.

I’m excited about where this path is heading and always looking to contribute to projects that are thoughtful, data-driven, and impactful.

Feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:data.zappe@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucaszappe), or just take a look at what I’ve been building.

Thanks for stopping by!
