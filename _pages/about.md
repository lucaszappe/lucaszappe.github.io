### Entry-level data analyst with a background in electrical engineering, transitioning from a career as a diving instructor.

<br>

Hi, I’m Lucas. I’m a data analyst with a bit of an unusual background.

After spending seven years as a diving instructor, I decided to transition into a new field and dive into data science. Recently, I earned the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, gaining foundational skills in data analysis that I have been working to improve. Besides honing my skills, I’ve been building my portfolio while searching for my first role in data science.

My curiosity and interest in technology have always been a big part of who I am. Originally, I graduated college with a degree in electrical engineering, but life’s currents guided me down a different path to diving. Recently, though, I felt a pull back towards tech, leading me to data science. 

To me, this is not as big of a leap as it might seem. Even as a diving instructor, I found myself drawn to questions that were related to data science. For instance, I’ve always wished I could predict dive site conditions based on current weather information. Similarly, I really enjoyed studying decompression theory and how scientists have modeled and experimented with gas transport in our bodies &mdash; a real concern in diving.

I'm really excited to see where this new direction takes me and to start contributing to the field of data science.

From the ocean to data science, my journey's been unique. If you're curious about the underwater world, check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/diving.lucas/).
